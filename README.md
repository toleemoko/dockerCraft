# NOTE: dockercraft may be unstable at this time as it is being developed to version 2.0
## That said, the docker image, and release 1.2.1 are working just fine! You can find both of those on the sidebar.
### For their' README, see [#README.md](https://github.com/toleemoko/dockerCraft/blob/master/%23README.md).


# Heads up, dockercraft has been put on hold for now, it was a good learning experience, but I just don't need to allocate my time here. Until we meet again.
